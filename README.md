# myShell
myShell is a program that attempts to replicate the sh shell. This program was written in C using macOS Sierra. myShell supports 67 commands by "exec-ing" previously written executables. In addition, myShell includes builtin commands that I wrote myself. The builtin commands are echo, help, cd, and exit.
